There is a goat icon on the cover of this book because putting it there made it easy to start this introduction. Also, goats are hilarious.

Moreover, goats are really smart, and they’d probably get damn good grades if they stopped yelling long enough to think about goat school.

Enough about goat grades, though - this book is meant to help you improve your grades.

A couple facts to put out there before we begin:

For most students, my opinion on grades is that they do not need to be perfect. After you deﬁne your goals, you’ll ﬁnd that your coursework is not a magical Hogwarts train that will take you to them. It’ll help, but alone it’s inadequate. Focus on getting good grades while also gaining skills outside of class, building things, doing extracurriculars, making connections and - yes - making time to have fun. Even if it’s just playing 10 minutes of Goat Simulator (don’t worry, that’s the last goat joke).

The main point of this book is to help you earn better grades, but the almost-as-important sub-focus is to cut down your study time. It’s my aim here to give you tools and tactics that help you perform better in less time. There’s a neat little equation I invented below that explains this a little better.

The Study Time Equation

What are the factors that actually go into earning awesome grades? In my mind, the best way to look at this is to envision the ﬁnal goal not as the tangible reward - the grade - but rather as the state of being you want to achieve.

I deﬁne this as Desired Preparedness. This applies to any class you’re in - or, to get more granular, to any speciﬁc exam/assignment/project.

The grade is simply a result you can use to quantify your desired preparedness. Once you’ve set that goal, there are four factors that will go into achieving it.

1.Class Time

2.Learning Quality

3.Study Time

4.Study Efﬁciency

Given those factors, here’s the initial form of the equation:

Pretty simple, no? Now we just do some algebraic ﬁddling to solve for Study Time:

<image: ICCBased(RGB,sRGB IEC61966-2.1), width: 950, height: 456, bpc: 8>

Assuming you’re committed to attending all your classes, Class Time is ﬁxed. It’s a constant. If you’ve already set a goal for Desired Preparedness, that’s ﬁxed for now as well.

This means you’ve got two variables to work with: Learning Quality and Study Efﬁciency. To decrease the amount of time you need to spend studying, increase either of them. Or be a baller and increase both.

Book Overview

The rest of this book is dedicated to giving you strategies and tactics to do just that. I’ve organized the book into 10 steps, each of which covers a different skill area:
